It's been a busy time at work and I have also moved home (to the building next door to where I was before).  I'm also lucky to have got a great new machine for work.  Whilst setting it up, I found out some interesting stuff about [getting the INSERT key working in Windows on a Mac](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2013/08/insert-key-usage-in-windows-on-a-mac/) and thought I'd write an article about it on the TPG 'blog, as it contains updates to advice I've found on and off the web.  Please [head over there](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2013/08/insert-key-usage-in-windows-on-a-mac/) to read it.
