...because these days you can relive the good/bad old days in HD(ish)!  I'll try to update this post as I find more 'cool' stuff.  This is somewhat biased towards the UK, and specifically 8-bit eras, with some '90s and early-web thrown in.  My first machine just for me was an Amiga; so much celebration and nostalgia to be had there, it's probably worth a separate article at some point.
