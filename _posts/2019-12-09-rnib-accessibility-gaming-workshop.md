I was thrilled to be invited to contribute a talk to the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)'s workshop on accessible games. It's always rewarding and motivating to meet people who are keen to learn about accessible games, and are passionate about supporting people in accessing them. The workshop provided me with a great opportunity to learn from people who provide accessibility support on a day-to-day basis.

On top of that, it was quite a novel experience, after being involved with vision impairment support organisations for a long time, to visit the RNIB's headquarters. Thanks to Sonali and the RNIB workshop team for a warm welcome.

It was ace catching up with, meeting and learning from leading game accessibility advocates and accessibility experts Ian, SightlessKombat, Adi, Dafydd, Sonali and all the workshop participants. Particularly interesting for me personally were our differing experiences of some of the same games. I left the workshop with a shortlist of some new awesome ones to play, too :-).
