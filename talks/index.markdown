## Landmarks

[Slides for "Landmarks"](2019-landmarks/) (screen-reader and mobile optimisation in-progress)

Presented at [London Accessibility Meet-up #26, May 2019 (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgZm-k8KMk&t=1h23m27s).

**Please note:** Dragon doesn't support landmark regions, as I thought it did during the Q&A (oops!); it supports ARIA roles for custom form controls, but not landmark roles.
