					<p class="story">Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ianhamilton_">Ian Hamilton</a> for general advice and <a href="https://twitter.com/blondehistorian">Dr Amy Kavanagh</a> for her "Blind Button Masher" talk at GAConf EU, which inspired some of the topics covered here.</p>

					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p class="story">There are three parts&hellip;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Assistive technology<span class="story"> and games</span></li>
						<li>Design<span class="story"> and vision impairment</span></li>
						<li>Community<span class="story"> involvement</span></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<h2>Assistive technology</h2>
					<p class="story">This section is generally about what you might call "traditional assistive technology" such as screen-magnifiers. Later on we'll also cover assistive features in specific games, and general inclusive design principles.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="slide middle">
					<h3>Assistive technology<span class="story"> on different platforms</span></h3>
					<p class="story">We'll cover&hellip;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Desktop</li>
						<li>Console</li>
						<li>Mobile</li>
						<li>VR</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p class="story">First, though, it's important to talk about a "technology" that goes hand-in-hand with all the above, which people with vision impairments often use, which we'll call "manual zoom". This is moving one's head closer to the object.</p>
					<p class="really-big">&#128269;</p>
					<p class="story">I use the manual zoom almost all the time, even in conjunction with other assistive technologies (though if I notice I'm doing it, I try to adjust things so that, e.g. I can read the computer screen with good posture). This does have the effect that sometimes I feel a bit like a typewriter, as I absent-mindedly manual-zoom and then snap back to the correct position when I notice.</p>
					<p class="story">With that being said, let's look at traditional assistive technologies across some different platforms&hellip;</p>
				</div>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p data-pause class="really-big">:-(<strong> *</strong></p>
					<p class="story">Generally, native-app style games on desktop platforms can't benefit from assistive technologies such as screen magnifiers. This is because most games completely take over control of the graphics card.</p>
					<p class="story">That being said, web-based games would potentially work with screen magnifiers and web browser zoom, but they may not be designed for it.</p>
				</div>

				<h3 class="full padded bottom slide horizontal" data-split="15% 85%">

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p data-pause class="really-big">:-)<strong> *</strong></p>
					<p class="story">There are assistive features such as pan-and-zoom (and invert colours) on consoles these days, and they can work alongside games.</p>
					<p class="story">However, games may not be designed with an awareness of them in mind&mdash;much as with web content when using a screen magnifier.</p>
					<p class="story">There are also features that enable you to get help from other people when playing games, such as Xbox's <a href="https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/account-profile/accessibility/copilot">co-pilot</a>, which lets two people play, with two controllers controlling the player's character. This allows each person to play the parts they can, and get help with other activities. In terms of vision impairment, exploration may be challenging sometimes (either in its entirety, or because it's easy to miss small-but-important things), so a co-player could assist with things like that.</p>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p data-pause class="really-big">:-)<strong> *</strong></p>
					<p class="story">There are assistive features such as pan-and-zoom (and invert colours) on iOS and Android, and they work at the system level, so they work alongside all apps and games.</p>
					<p class="story">As above, though games may not be designed with an awareness of them.</p>
					<p class="story">Here are some examples of games that work with screen magnification on mobile and, thus, I can play them&hellip;</p>
				</div>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img src="images/sorcery2a.png" alt="Interactive adventure-book game Sorcery! - zoomed view of the map showing the player's avatar">
					<figcaption class="story">The Sorcery! series recreates the experience of a choose-your-own-adventure book digitally, which is very cool. Here, the player is shown on a simple map, with the choice of direction indicated by tapping on the map.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img src="images/sorcery2b.png" alt="Text fragments and user choice in Sorcery!">
					<figcaption class="story">Alas, the layout is such that in order to read the text, I have to zoom in to that part of the screen a lot. I am not sure if it's designed to work well with mobile screen readers.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img class="border" src="images/blackbar.png" alt="Blackbar gameplay invoves guessing words that have been redacted from correspondence you've been sent">
					<figcaption class="story">Blackbar is another great game that revolves around text, with very simple gameplay involving filling in words, but still evoking a sinister and compelling atmosphere. I am not sure if it is designed to work well with screen readers.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img src="images/a-dark-room.png" alt="A Dark Room screen featuring largely text and ocasionally a few buttons">
					<figcaption class="story">A Dark Room is another game that evokes a vibrant and immersive world through text alone (and some ASCII art at times). If memory serves correctly, this one does work reasonably well with mobile screen readers.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p>However, you can miss important<br class="slides">stuff when zoomed in<span class="slides">.</span><span class="story">, as the following example shows.</span></p>
				</div>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img src="images/machinarium-z1.png" alt="Scene from Machinarium: a cute little robot in a sort of scrap yard, with instructional text on how to play the game in the top-right.">
					<figcaption class="story">In Machinarium, I was zoomed into the area of this screen where the robot is, on the left, and missed some of the help text on the right, but I did see some of it, so I was alerted to the fact that I was missing something, and re-started in order to read it.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img src="images/machinarium-z2.png" alt="The same scene from Machinarium, with an arrow pointing to where the user needs to tap to bring up the game menu at the bottom of the screen">
					<figcaption class="story">I completely missed this help text on my first play-through.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p>Games on mobile devices<br class="slides"><span class="story"> could also be seen </span><strong>as</strong> assistive technology<span class="story">.</span></p>
					<p class="story">Sometimes games themselves could be considered as assistive technologies, when their presence on a different platform enables people to play them when previously they couldn't. A great example of this can be digital versions of physical board games, which can help players by carrying out repetitive or demanding actions, such as set-up and moving pieces appropriately. They can also automatically carry out actions that need to happen every turn, which players of the physical game must perform manually.</p>
				</div>

				<figure class="slide full">
					<img src="images/pandemic.png" alt="Screen from the digital version of the game Pandemic. The main play area is a map of the world, showing where disease outbreaks have occured. The player's hand is also shown at the bottom of the screen.">
					<figcaption class="story">The digital version of Pandemic keeps track of the players' turns and actions, and carries out disease propagation tasks as required between turns.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p>One more thing&hellip;</p>
					<p class="story">You can use some mobile devices, such as the iPad <strong>as</strong> an assistive technology. As with apps, games can benefit from the larger screen size. You can also enlarge games designed for the iPhone on the iPad using the &quot;x2&quot; button.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="slide middle centre">
					<p class="really-big"><span class="x2-button">x2<span class="visually-hidden"> button</span></span></p>
					<p class="story">However most games these days seem to have variants specifically designed for iPad, which means they usually keep the small text in exchange for larger screen-space for displaying the game world.</p>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Virtual Reality is really exciting these days. I have not got VR at home, but I have been lucky to try it out a few times, and the promise in terms of storytelling and fun is tantalising. Here's a trailer for an upcoming game from a well-respected developer that looks and sounds very compelling.</p>
					<iframe title="Half-Life: Alyx" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2W0N3uKXmo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Microsoft has been doing some research into accessibility in VR environments, with very interesting results. The SeeingVR toolkit is a set of Unity (a very popular game engine and development environment) plugins that provide assistive features for VR environments.</p>
					<p class="story">Some of these are post-processing filters that require no intervention from the developer (e.g. contrast and edge enhancement). Others are parameterised and require some input (e.g. highlighting important objects). The possibilities for improving access in games and other scenarios are tantalising.</p>
					<p class="story"><em>One really interesting idea about accessibility in VR&mdash;alas I'm no longer sure where I picked this up&mdash;is that the virtual world could provide things like magnifying glasses to act as assistive technologies in-keeping with the world. I find this idea fascinating, though I would rather somehow have the world adapt to my needs. It did make me think that maybe these sorts of experiences could be used to show people without disabilities what it's like having one, but I digress.</em></p>

				<h2 class="slide middle centre">Design</h2>

				<div class="slide middle">
					<h3 class="slides">Design</h3>
					<p class="story">Content design is paramount in games, and can achieve a huge amount for accessibility, as well as providing an immersive and compelling world for players. This section discusses several aspects of design that can have a large effect on accessibility. We're going to talk about&hellip;</p>
					<ul class="two-column-list">

					<p class="story">Before we do, though, I can't emphasise enough that for great accessibility advice, including examples of games that embody that advice well, you should really check out the <a href="http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/">Game Accessibility Guidelines</a>, created by Ian Hamilton, Barrie Ellis, Gareth Ford-Williams, Lynsey Graham, Dimitris Grammenos, Headstrong Games, Ed Lee, Jake Manion and Thomas Westin&hellip;</p>

					<p class="slides really-big">#1</p>
					<p class="story">Text size is the #1 complaint about game accessibility.</p>
					<p class="story">As an example, I was <strong>really</strong> looking forward to exploring the wonderfully-realised world of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, as earlier entries in the series are some of my most favourite games, and favourites of many others too. The following video shows someone walking around one of the early areas, finding all sorts of interesting details and characters, but then alas picking up an e-book and&hellip; the font size is tiny and can't be configured: d'oh!</p>
				</div>

				<iframe title="Deus Ex: Human Revolution" class="slide full" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Va8G6c0vBvM?start=380" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">There are some good features in this environment and in the game: the signage in this facility has quite large type, and the game's mini-map uses shape as well as colour to indicate what it's indicating (though a bit of manual zoom is required to read the head-up display, or "HUD").</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/dxhr-sarif-industries.jpg" alt="The atrium of the Sarif Industries futuristic office complex, featuring escalators, a reception desk and signage.">
					</figure>
				</div>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">However, the e-books and similar interfaces, like the computer terminal pictured below, have a fixed and not too big font size, and perhaps some contrast issues too.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/dxhr-computer.jpg" alt="A computer terminal in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, showing some emails.">
					</figure>
				</div>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">But this is an eminently solvable problem. The original Unreal Tournament game (a wildly popular and venerated multiplayer-focused first-person shooter), released in 1999, provided an option in its user interface to double the size of fonts and all UI elements.</p>
					<p class="story">This was super-helpful for me, even though I only ran the game at relatively low resolutions, as it enabled me to access the interface quite easily. (In fact I use the same technique on my Mac these days to make its UI a bit easier to read, but not rely on screen magnification.)</p>
					<p class="story"><em>Incidentally, Unreal Tournament's GUI was quite sophisticated&mdash;to the point that one popular modification for the game was not actually a change to the way the main game worked, but a <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/tetris">re-recreation of the classic puzzler Tetris, which ran in the in-game GUI</a>. Generally, interfaces have got simpler since thing, and that's a good thing, but if a twenty-year-old game can provide such a sophisticated user interface, with a scaling option, then more games should!</em></p>
					<figure>
						<img alt="The 'Video' tab of Unreadl Tournament's Preferences dialog, containing various resolution options and the 'Font Size' option, set to 'Double'" src="images/video-prefs.png">
					</figure>
					<p class="story">Being able to scale text and the UI is becoming even more important for developers, too. Nowadays the industry is starting to consider cross-platform games, and even streaming games across multiple devices. This means games may be presented on a wide range of displays, of wildly different sizes. Techniques to make these accessible could be very useful&mdash;and there's a great example of <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/research/supple/">adaptive user interfaces that tailor themselves to the user and device's needs</a> from the world of research.</p>

				<div class="slide full middle centre">
					<p class="story">Some games have options to assist users who struggle to see colours. For example, Frozen Bubble offers an option to include shapes as well as colours. This is what it looks like normally&hellip;</p>

					<p class="story">However, it is better when the game is designed to not need such an option&mdash;in much the same spirit as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color">the WCAG SC about using more than colour to provide information</a> and in fact there's a <a href="http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/ensure-no-essential-information-is-conveyed-by-a-colour-alone/">Game Accessibility Guideline about using more than colour to provide information</a> too.</p>

					<span>Detail</span>
				</h3>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Games have generally got considerably more detailed over time&mdash;from the resolution of the overall display, and the number of colours and textures simultaneously displayed, to the level of detail in the characters, objects and locales in the game world.</p>
					<p class="story">Because earlier games were limited quite significantly by display resolution and palette, they often employed styles and techniques that made them more accessible, such as large text and high-contrast colours. When coupled with original gameplay and well-made storytelling or solid action, some early games are still favourites.</p>
					<p class="story">The Descent series was a pioneering six-degrees-of-freedom robotic first-person-shooter, with low-res graphics and enticing bright colours.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/Descent_II_gameplay.png" alt="The player's ship's cockpit in Descent II, looking through this mine's red door towards the reactor, with some enemy robots visible. The colours are bright, text relatively large and the resolution low.">

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Overload is a modern rekindling of the elements that made Descent so special. It has a retro look, but is considerably higher-resolution. It's also quite colourful, which makes a pleasant change from the muted palettes of greys and browns that pervade modern "realistic" games.</p>

					<p class="story">A scene from the original and rather low-res seminal first-person-shooter Doom. The resolution is low, so fairly bright colours are used to distinguish the walls, floor and radioactive pools from the enemies.</p>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Here's a scene from Doom 3, which has massive amounts of detail in the scene geometry and the model of the Revenant enemy that the player is facing. But there is a more realistic look, with a detailed but rather muted palette, which can make it hard to take in all that detail.</p>

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Adventure games have changed in visual fidelity a great deal too. Here's a cult classic called "Beneath A Steel Sky". The scene is limited by its low resolution, but this has encouraged a lot of creativity from the designers, who've successfully evoked a compelling world. The colours are reasonably bright, and the text that shows what the characters are saying is quite large.</p>
					<p class="story"><em>Incidentally, the text is mainly there because the floppy-disk version of the game couldn't accommodate voice recordings for all the dialogue, but they did still include the text in the version with the spoken words, so they kind-of acted like subtitles, and were nice and big and easy to read.</em></p>

					<p class="story">Modern games such as Forza Horizon 4, which look so realistic that I almost thought this screengrab was a photograph at first, provide a pretty fantastic experience to the player, but I struggle with taking in the important detail out of all the detail that is available there.</p>
					<p class="story">It should be noted however that, as with many other game developers, the team behind Forza is putting much work into accessibility features. Some examples of existing features include the extensive array of <a href="http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/forza-horizon-3-difficulty-settings/">driver assists</a> that are on offer in the game. These include: showing the optimal driving line in the form of blue chevrons on the track/road surface; automated braking, shifting and steering, and other features.</p>

So even though the colour palette is somewhat muted, it's usually not to hard for me to figure out what's going on. The highly variable zoom levels help a bit there, too.</p>

					<p class="story">The immersive action-parkour game Mirror's Edge tasks the player as a "runner"&mdash;someone who can courier sensitive information between people, across the rooftops, away from the prying network-monitoring eyes of the dodgy city-state. The player must negotiate many different and varied obstacles, and the game feels like it is very free-roaming. But in order to help the player know where to go, they're imbued with "runner-vision", which causes objects they need to traverse to stay on-track to appear bright red.</p>
					<p class="story">Runner-vision is great because of its high-contrast nature, which fits well with the overall aesthetic of the game, which is generally white surroundings on the rooftops with occasional splashes of colour, beneath a clear blue sky. Because of that I find it fairly accessible. But also it gives the player the ability to keep moving and really get into the flow of the parkour, which makes the whole game compelling and immersive.</p>

					<p class="story">Half-Life was a landmark in first-person shooters, as it brought the narrative right into the game. One of the most popular ways of conveying the story to players previously was by having video cutscenes between levels. In Half-Life, though, the player is fully immersed in the story because set-piece events simply happen right there whilst you're exploring the level. This is now the standard for the industry.</p>

					<p class="story"><em>Incidentally, when Valve software created their own in-house engine for Half-Life's sequels and other projects, they added closed caption support.

					<p class="story">Unreal, a contemporary of Half-Life, used a more traditional means to provide the story&mdash;the player could pick up books, diaries and computer pads left by people (and aliens), and read them. The story was pretty cool&mdash;and that game too is a classic, full of huge, diverse, but exceptionally well-themed and vibrant environments, so it always grabbed my attention&mdash;but this way of storytelling is less accessible, particularly due to the lack of variable font size (Unreal predates the awesome efforts done on Unreal Tournament).</p>

Lifeline is a casual game that takes place over several days. You receive a notification (on your watch or phone) from a desperate traveller who crashed on an alien planet, and needs your help to survive.</p>
					<p class="story">Gameplay usually consists of getting a notification (or two), making a decision and sending back a canned response to the stranded traveller. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but having the experience as if this person is really sending messages to you, and having to do things like searching the web for answers to really unusual questions. It can also be quite accessible, as you can use at least some traditional assistive technologies to access the content, and you can take it at your own pace. A really novel fun time!</p>

					<p class="story">We discussed Chameleon Run earlier, and how accessible it can be. However, as with many games&mdash;even those that are bright, clear and only require one switch to operate&mdash;I often find a point where things just happen too fast on-screen for me to react. It would be great to see the developers offer an option to slow things down.</p>
					<p class="story">One really popular activity with gamers is to make "speedruns" of their favourite levels or games. These involve them completing the game as quickly as possible without cheating&mdash;though they often use odd glitches in the game that are researched and discovered over time. People like racing, even digitally :-). Anyway, here's a speedrun of the first level of Chameleon Run. Whilst no casual gamer would play it this fast, it simulates how it feels to be overwhelmed by the speed of things.</p>

The turn-based strategy game Worms sees rival teams of worms fight it out over a randomly-generated landscape with a vast array of high-tech assault weaponry. And priceless Ming vases, and holy hand grenades. (It's awesome :-).) The game also provides very smooth zooming in and out of the theatre of combat, which is nice.</p>

					<p class="story">Quite often in games, there'll come a point of crisis for a character and the frantic nature of trying to get out of that crisis&mdash;either an oncoming obstacle, or the prospect of a finishing blow from an opponent&mdash;is represented by the need to press certain buttons on the controller at precisely the right time.

					<p class="story">Many moons ago I worked on a proof-of-concept tool for mapping that used structured-text descriptions of the levels to be created, rather than a visual interface. Here is an example of a map for the ancient but venerable Quake in a traditional graphical 3D editor&hellip;</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/t3dl-e.png" alt="A simple level being designed in a level-creation program called QuArK. Two rooms are adjacent, but one is slightly higher up than the ohter, so there's a set of stairs to get from one to the other, as well as a door.">

				<figure class="slide full"><img src="images/t3dl-g.png" alt="First-person view from the lower of the two rooms looking on at the stairs and door into the other room. Military base textures have been applied: corrugated steel walls and a tiled floor."></figure>

				<div class="slide middle centre slightly-smaller-font">
					<div class="story">
						<p>However, we could express this problem a different way: we could describe the relationships between the different rooms in the level, and how we might like the map textured and lit, and then have the computer create the actual layout for us.</p>
						<p>The following XML description gives us the same information as the design in the CAD-like editor above.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-markdown><!--
					```xml
					<map name=’Stair connection' style=’base’>
					  <room id=’start’>
					    <item pos=’c’ type=’info_player_start’ />
					    <con type=’door’ target=’other’ wall=’n’

				<div class="slide full">
					<p class="story">Another way people can get creative with games is modifying the way the game behaves, rather than the environment in which the player plays (or, even, as well as the environment). A very popular class-based capture-the-flag game called Team Fortress started out as a modification, or "mod" for Quake. Later it was re-implemented in Half-Life and then it eventually was given its own separate release, with a quite highly tweaked graphical style, as a stand-alone game called Team Fortress 2.</p>
					<p class="story">This all came about due to the original effort of people in the community. It's actually happened several times now that a fan-made mod ends up turning into a major stand-alone gaming title, often with the fans who developed it getting hired as developers in the process.</p>
					<p class="story">Providing access to modding games, much as with mapping, can be a really great educational and creative experience.</p>

					<p class="story">For making modifications, one of the main tools needed is a code editor. It could be one that comes with the game, thus requiring that accessibility was considered in the development of its UI, or it could be any standard editor.</p>

						<h2>In summary&hellip;</h2>
						<p>I hope you have enjoyed this wandering through my experiences as a gamer with a vision impairment. There are a number of things that we have covered&hellip;</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Games are awesome.</li>
							<li>They present a lot of accessibility challenges.</li>
							<li>There are also a lot of accessibility opportunities, and developers are working on many improvements in these areas.</li>
							<li>The design choices that go into game content are just as important, if not more so, than integration with assistive technologies&hellip;</li>
							<li>&hellip;but the more integration with players' assistive technologies, the better :-).</li>
							<li>Also of vital importance is access to the surrounding community of playing, communicating about, mapping and modding games.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>As others in the seminar have pointed out, the best thing that developers can do is continue talking to disabled gamers and getting us involved in the game design process.</p>
						<p>It's a very exciting time to be a gamer!</p>
